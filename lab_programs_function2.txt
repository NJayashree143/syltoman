Lab Section 1:

1. :
2. Implement Three nodes point – to – point network with duplex links between them for different
topologies. 1Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth, and find the number of packets dropped for
various iterations.

Lab Section 2:

1. :
2. Implement simple ESS and with transmitting nodes in wire-less LAN by simulation and
determine the throughput with respect to transmission of packets
3. Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16- bits).

Lab Section 3:

1. :
2. Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a network topology consisting of 6
nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion in the network.
3. Write a program to find the shortest path between vertices using bellman-ford algorithm.

Lab Section 4:

1. :
2. Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot congestion
window for different source / destination.
3. Write a program for congestion control using leaky bucket algorithm.
